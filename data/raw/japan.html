<p dir="ltr"><u id="do’s" class="culture-subheading">Do’s</u></p><ul>
<li dir="ltr">Express flattery when it is due as this will give <span class="glossary-link js-show-glossary-modal" data-id="10">face</span> to the recipient, however always do so earnestly. An insincere compliment can cause a person to lose <span class="glossary-link js-show-glossary-modal" data-id="10">face</span> instead. Furthermore, do not compliment a single person too profusely since their obligation to humbly deny praise can make them become embarrassed. </li>
<li dir="ltr">It is good to add a lot of reassurance during conversation. </li>
<li dir="ltr">If you reflect on an interaction with a Japanese person and feel you may have come across impolitely, it is okay to apologise for the rudeness the next time you see them. In Japan, apologies are made several times a day for rudeness that was not actually committed.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The Japanese often smile and nod throughout conversation. Remember that this is done out of <span class="glossary-link js-show-glossary-modal" data-id="29">politeness</span> to save <span class="glossary-link js-show-glossary-modal" data-id="10">face</span> and does not necessarily indicate that they fully understand or agree with what you are saying. Therefore, if you notice that your Japanese counterpart’s English is limited, try not to interpret their encouraging nodding as a cue that they totally comprehend what you are saying. </li>
<li dir="ltr">Make a considered effort to be humble and modest. It is polite to lightheartedly disagree with people when they compliment you.</li>
</ul><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><u id="don’ts" class="culture-subheading">Don’ts</u></p><ul>
<li dir="ltr">Avoid being blunt or frank about delicate topics. Sometimes blatant honesty can be unappreciated as the Japanese form of communication is very <span class="glossary-link js-show-glossary-modal" data-id="17">indirect</span>. Negative news is delivered more discreetly.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Do not raise your voice or lose your temper. Losing control of one’s emotions even in the most frustrating situations is a sign of poor upbringing and is likely to make you lose <span class="glossary-link js-show-glossary-modal" data-id="10">face</span> in a Japanese person’s eyes.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Do not tell third parties about a conversation you’ve had with another Japanese person unless they have made it clear that it is okay to do so.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Avoid discussing sensitive historical and political topics such as World War II.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Avoid being openly critical or pointing out mistakes. The Japanese may take criticism quite personally. For example, if they have taken you to a restaurant and you do not like a dish served, commenting on its quality may be taken as a comment on their skills as a host even though they did not prepare the dish. Such occurrences can quickly cause a Japanese person to lose <span class="glossary-link js-show-glossary-modal" data-id="10">face</span>.</li>

Although primarily associated with the Hindu tradition in India, the caste system is also present among other religions and south Asian countries such as Sri Lanka and Nepal. The caste system represents two different overlapping systems of stratification.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe large-scale caste system is known as the \u0026lsquo;\u003cem\u003evarna\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003esystem. This classifies society into four broad categories; \u003cem\u003ebrahmin\u003c/em\u003e (priestly caste), \u003cem\u003ekshatriya\u003c/em\u003e (nobility caste), \u003cem\u003evaishya\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e(merchant caste) and \u003cem\u003eshudra\u003c/em\u003e (artisan or labourer caste). The varna system was viewed by some members of society as the ideal social structure. However, over time particular castes in the bottom tier became stigmatised as \u0026lsquo;less pure\u0026rsquo; compared to higher castes, and interactions between them were limited. The idea of the \u0026lsquo;\u003cem\u003edalits\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;untouchables\u0026rsquo;) was a modern addition. This category, thought to be outside of the caste system, was understood as the lowest rank and \u0026lsquo;least pure\u0026rsquo; members of Indian society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe small-scale caste system, known as the\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026lsquo;jati\u0026#39;\u003c/em\u003e system, comprises jati categories that determines one\u0026rsquo;s occupation, vocation, location, line of study or trade based on their family of birth. These jatis are ranked, with some considered to be caste-neutral (such as agriculture or non-traditional civil service). The\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003ejati system is particularly noticeable in the daily social organisation of some south Asian cultures. For example, the system explains why it is common to find people following the professions of their parents, grandparents and so on.\u003c/p\u003e","created_at":"2016-03-16T23:59:52.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T02:47:44.000Z","related_terms":"","source":"","slug":"caste-system","image_file_name":null,"image_content_type":null,"image_file_size":null,"image_updated_at":null},{"id":5,"title":"Collectivism","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eCollectivist cultures are group-centric.

In collectivist cultures, groups reflect or come to define who its members are and often entail overriding loyalty. For instance, individuals may tend to privilege the group\u0026rsquo;s interests over their own, even if they conflict. Furthermore, those who are in the same group often expect to receive preferential treatment from other group-members.

This requires a person to give a public impression of dignity and integrity through stressing their achievements and recommending qualities. In Western society, self-criticism can position a person beyond moral reproach by others. In places with an honour culture, society pressures individuals to defer and deny guilt that could tarnish their honour. Any admittance to error or failure brings shame and loss of face on a person (and their family) by peers.
